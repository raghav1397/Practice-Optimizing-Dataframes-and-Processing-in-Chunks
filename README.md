# Practice Optimizing Dataframes and Processing in Chunks

we'll practice working with chunked dataframes and optimizing a dataframe's memory usage. We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club, a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers with investors. You can read more about the marketplace on its website.

The Lending Club's website lists approved loans. Qualified investors can view the borrower's credit score, the purpose of the loan, and other details in the loan applications. Once a lender is ready to back a loan, it selects the amount of money it wants to fund. When the loan amount the borrower requested is fully funded, the borrower receives the money, minus the origination fee that Lending Club charges.

We'll be working with a dataset of loans approved from 2007-2011, which you can download from Lending Club's website. We've already removed the desc column for you to make our system run more quickly.
